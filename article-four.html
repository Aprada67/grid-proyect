                    <p class="txt">Because you want to admit it or not, we are over-informed. Limit the consumption of television, mobile or even elevator conversations that comment on the current state of society, politics or the news.<br>
                    <br>
                    In general, all the information that bombards our brain leaves a residue in it of images, symbols and, ultimately, noise, which leaves an echo and does not allow us to relieve it of stress.<br>
                    <br>    
                    Social networks become a showcase ready to make us enter into the comparison, the desires of the ego and self-imposed needs. Like television, trash TV shows, newscasts or series. They tell you what to believe, where to put your attention,and what things should matter to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you pay attention, while you are in front of the screen, "you don't think". You distract yourself from the reality of your life and in a sense, you numb yourself from everything you have in it.<br>
                    <br>
                    And I'm not saying that you get away from all this overnight, but rather that you be more aware of how much time you invest in it every day and decide to limit your consumption for your mental health. Try to see one day, and if you want tell me.
