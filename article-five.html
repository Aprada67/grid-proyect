                    <p class="txt">Start classes with a teacher or teacher who inspires you, who you feel has implemented yoga in their day to day and do not choose it solely because of the number of followers they have or their physical appearance.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are those who feel this practice very deeply and who will be able to guide you to show you that yoga is much more than physical activity. Attend classes, group or individual, face-to-face or online, but if it's your first time, start with someone who can motivate you and teach you to practice safely.<br>
                    <br>
                    Yoga will not only help you connect with your body, giving you greater body awareness, strength or flexibility, but it will also help you generate greater well-being in your life.
